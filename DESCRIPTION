Description: Combined various decision tree algorithms, plus both
             linear regression and ensemble methods into one package. 
             Allows for the use of both continuous and categorical outcomes.
             An optional feature is to quantify the (in)stability to the 
             decision tree methods, indicating when results can be trusted
             and when ensemble methods may be preferential.
